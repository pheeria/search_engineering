# Description:
# Default configuration for OpenSearch Dashboards

# OpenSearch Dashboards is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
# server.port: 5601

# Specifies the address to which the OpenSearch Dashboards server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.
# The default is 'localhost', which usually means remote machines will not be able to connect.
# To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.
# server.host: "localhost"

# Enables you to specify a path to mount OpenSearch Dashboards at if you are running behind a proxy.
# Use the `server.rewriteBasePath` setting to tell OpenSearch Dashboards if it should remove the basePath
# from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup.
# This setting cannot end in a slash.
# server.basePath: ""

# Specifies whether OpenSearch Dashboards should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
# `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
# server.rewriteBasePath: false

# The maximum payload size in bytes for incoming server requests.
# server.maxPayloadBytes: 1048576

# The OpenSearch Dashboards server's name.  This is used for display purposes.
# server.name: "your-hostname"

# The URLs of the OpenSearch instances to use for all your queries.
# opensearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

# OpenSearch Dashboards uses an index in OpenSearch to store saved searches, visualizations and
# dashboards. OpenSearch Dashboards creates a new index if the index doesn't already exist.
# opensearchDashboards.index: ".opensearch_dashboards"


# Setting for an optimized healthcheck that only uses the local OpenSearch node to do Dashboards healthcheck.
# This settings should be used for large clusters or for clusters with ingest heavy nodes.
# It allows Dashboards to only healthcheck using the local OpenSearch node rather than fan out requests across all nodes.


# It requires the user to create an OpenSearch node attribute with the same name as the value used in the setting
# This node attribute should assign all nodes of the same cluster an integer value that increments with each new cluster that is spun up
# e.g. in opensearch.yml file you would set the value to a setting using node.attr.cluster_id:
# Should only be enabled if there is a corresponding node attribute created in your OpenSearch config that matches the value here
# opensearch.optimizedHealthcheckId: "cluster_id"

# If your OpenSearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
# the username and password that the OpenSearch Dashboards server uses to perform maintenance on the OpenSearch Dashboards
# index at startup. Your OpenSearch Dashboards users still need to authenticate with OpenSearch, which
# is proxied through the OpenSearch Dashboards server.
# opensearch.username: "opensearch_dashboards_system"
# opensearch.password: "pass"

# Enables SSL and paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and SSL key files, respectively.
# These settings enable SSL for outgoing requests from the OpenSearch Dashboards server to the browser.
# server.ssl.enabled: false
# server.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/server.crt
# server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key

# Optional settings that provide the paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and key files.
# These files are used to verify the identity of OpenSearch Dashboards to OpenSearch and are required when
# xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication in OpenSearch is set to required.
# opensearch.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/client.crt
# opensearch.ssl.key: /path/to/your/client.key

# Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the PEM file for the certificate
# authority for your OpenSearch instance.
# opensearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: [ "/path/to/your/CA.pem" ]

# To disregard the validity of SSL certificates, change this setting's value to 'none'.
# opensearch.ssl.verificationMode: full

# Time in milliseconds to wait for OpenSearch to respond to pings. Defaults to the value of
# the opensearch.requestTimeout setting.
# opensearch.pingTimeout: 1500

# Time in milliseconds to wait for responses from the back end or OpenSearch. This value
# must be a positive integer.
# opensearch.requestTimeout: 30000

# opensearch.shardTimeout: 30000

# Logs queries sent to OpenSearch. Requires logging.verbose set to true.
# opensearch.logQueries: false

# Specifies the path where OpenSearch Dashboards creates the process ID file.
# pid.file: /var/run/opensearchDashboards.pid

# Enables you to specify a file where OpenSearch Dashboards stores log output.
# logging.dest: stdout

# Set the value of this setting to true to suppress all logging output.
